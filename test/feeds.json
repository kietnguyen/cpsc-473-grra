{ _id: 2, title: "The Verge - Teches", url: "http://www.theverge.com/rss/group/tech/index.xml", description: "",  items: [ { "title" : "Uber launching bike courier service in Manhattan tomorrow", "url" : "http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/7/5591442/uber-rush-bike-courier-service-pilot-in-manhattan", "description" : "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/31284485/uberlogo.0_standard_800.0.png\" />\n\n\n\n  <p>Uber will begin testing a new service in Manhattan tomorrow, but the new service isn't designed to get you around: instead, it's launching a courier service called Uber Rush, which will let you hire a bike messenger to pick up your items and bring them to another location in the city,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/7/5590876/uber-is-going-to-launch-a-messenger-service\">reports&nbsp;<i>Vox</i></a>. The service will reportedly only operate in Manhattan to start, and couriers won't be able to travel north of 110th Street &mdash; no higher than top of Central Park.&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-07/with-uber-rush-the-car-service-tests-manhattan-only-courier-service\"><i>Bloomberg Businessweek </i>reports</a> that rates begin at $15 for a trip and can go as high as $30, depending on how far the courier has to go. Surge pricing won't be used, at least for now.</p>\r\n<p>Though Uber has dabbled in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/13/3157208/uber-ice-cream-truck-friday\">a number of</a> <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/1/4483376/uber-helicopter-flights-hamptons-uberchopper\">eclectic professions</a> for promotions and holidays, a courier service will be the first distinctly different core service that it offers, with all of its other products being different takes on taxi services. Uber Rush will only be a pilot program, so it's possible that it won't roll out further if it doesn't succeed. It's also fairly basic for now &mdash; only allowing customers to have products picked up from them, and not purchased for them as similar courier services do. Uber tells <i>Bloomberg</i> that it's been seeing people hire cabs just to ferry their items around the city though, so perhaps Uber is simply responding to untapped demand.</p>\r\n \r\n<hr class=\"widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break\">\n<blockquote lang=\"en\" class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>We're rolling out some big news on Tuesday... <a href=\"http://t.co/1pDPy8oV2p\">pic.twitter.com/1pDPy8oV2p</a></p>\r\n&mdash; Uber NYC (@Uber_NYC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Uber_NYC/statuses/452480045500874752\">April 5, 2014</a>\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>", "pubDate" : ISODate("2014-04-07T21:33:23.000Z"), "author" : "Jacob Kastrenakes", "_id" : ObjectId("534327dbc1c912e72cafe73e") }, { "title" : "Teaching cameras to photograph dark skin", "url" : "http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/7/5590652/teaching-cameras-to-photograph-dark-skin", "description" : "<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/31274385/dsc_3283.0_standard_800.0.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n  <p>How can African-Americans deal with film stock designed for caucasian skin? At Buzzfeed Ideas, Syreeta McFadden <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/syreetamcfadden/teaching-the-camera-to-see-my-skin\">runs down the history</a> of the problem across different cameras and film stocks. Growing up in the era of Kodak Gold Stock, McFadden struggled to find a process that didn't make her skin look charcoaly, dull yellow, or strangely bluish. Capturing naturally darker skin tones was a huge problem for Gold Stock, both because of standardized processing techniques and the chemical properties of the film itself. The recent shift to digital has opened up the process a little, allowing for more flexible consumer-grade color correction, but the politics of the histogram is still alive and well on film.</p>", "pubDate" : ISODate("2014-04-07T18:15:02.000Z"), "author" : "Russell Brandom", "_id" : ObjectId("534327dbc1c912e72cafe73f") } ] }
